A programmer is someone <strong>who writes code that tells a computer or some other device what to do.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the case of a <strong>software developer<\/strong>, they take a concept or design and <strong>write the code that tells the computer how to execute this concept<\/strong>. In the case of someone like a <strong>web developer<\/strong>, they <strong>take a proposed website design and build it by writing the necessary code<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In most situations, <strong>a computer programmer is building or creating something based on someone else&rsquo;s design parameters.<\/strong> However, some programmers design their programs, so this is always an option if you&rsquo;re an entrepreneurial kind of person!<\/p>\n<p>Now that we have answered the question &lsquo;<em>What does a computer programmer do?&rsquo;<\/em>, let&rsquo;s move onto <strong>how to learn programming and become a good programmer<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>How To Become A Programmer: Step By Step Guide<\/h2>\n<p><em>Learning programming is hard<\/em>, I&rsquo;m not going to lie. However, when you compare it to other skills and career paths, becoming a programmer will be one of the easiest choices you make!<\/p>\n<ul class=\"pros-check\">\n<li>Programmers <strong>work in a very exciting field<\/strong> where every day brings new challenges and new knowledge.<\/li>\n<li>Programmers <strong>have the opportunity to work for themselves<\/strong>, to work whatever hours they want, and to work from home if they want to.<\/li>\n<li>Programming is <strong>pretty easy to learn when compared to other skills<\/strong> that can take three or more years at university. <em>Sure, you could waste a few years of your life and learn programming at uni<\/em>, but why would you when <strong>you can <a href=\"\/goon\/edx-homepage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\">learn it in a few months online?<\/a> <\/strong>Platforms such as Udemy offer <a href=\"\/goon\/introduction-to-python-programming-udemy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\"><strong>great courses for beginners to try out<\/strong><\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As you can see, there are plenty of reasons why you would want to become a programmer. Luckily for you, I&rsquo;m here to show you <strong>exactly how to do just that in seven simple steps. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>By the way, one of the best things about learning programming is that there are so many ways to do it. You can enroll in an <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/potomac.edu\/it-degree-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\">IT degree program<\/a><\/strong>, or start on your own with online courses, exercises, and peer help.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Step 1: Understand Why You Want To Start Programming<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The first and one of the most important steps on how to become a programmer is <strong>identifying your reasons for starting<\/strong>. Sit down and have a good hard think about the following questions, as your answers will help you decide exactly which path to take:<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Why do you want to learn programming? <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>This is a very important question that you absolutely <strong>must ask yourself<\/strong> before you go any further. Do you want to <strong>turn it into a career<\/strong>? Do you <strong>have a project or concept that you want to turn into a reality on your own?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"How to become a programmer: man thinking\" src=\"https:\/\/media.bitdegree.org\/storage\/media\/images\/man thinking.o.jpg\" alt=\"How to become a programmer: man thinking\" width=\"680\" height=\"367\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Or do you simply want to learn how to be a programmer because <strong>it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s &lsquo;cool&rsquo; at the moment?<\/strong> Answer honestly, because the language that you choose to learn will depend on your answer to this question.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>What do you hope to do with your new knowledge? <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Again, you need to identify <strong>exactly what you want to do with your new programming knowledge<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the courses you need to take and the languages you need to learn if you want to become a software developer or systems engineer <strong>will be a lot different<\/strong> from the skills you need to make a few changes to the layout of your blog.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Are you serious about learning to program? <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>This <strong>a very important question to ask<\/strong>. Are you serious about learning how to become a programmer and in getting a job in the field, <em>or is it just a fad<\/em>? If you are serious, then you need to be able to <strong>allocate as much time as possible to learning programming skills so that you can start working ASAP!<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4><strong>What sort of programming do you want to do? <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>More on this in <strong><em>Step 2<\/em><\/strong>, but you need to think closely about <strong>what sort of programming you want to do <\/strong>and what field you want to go into.<\/p>\n<p>Do you want to become a <strong>back-end web developer<\/strong>? <strong>A software engineer<\/strong>? Or do you want to <strong>work on something like artificial intelligence<\/strong> (AI) or another emerging technology? The answer to this question will help shape the learning pathway that you take, so be honest with yourself.<\/p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"How to become a programmer: man thinking\" src=\"https:\/\/media.bitdegree.org\/storage\/media\/images\/man deciding.o.jpg\" alt=\"How to become a programmer: man thinking\" width=\"680\" height=\"454\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once you have answered these questions honestly and recorded your answers, it&rsquo;s time to <strong>move onto step two<\/strong>: choosing what sort of programming you want to do and then we'll move on to the question on how to become a programmer.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Step 2: Decide What Field You Want To Go Into<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There are a <strong>variety of different types of programming<\/strong>. When you are figuring out how to learn programming, you need to think very carefully about <strong>what field you are planning on looking for work in.<\/strong> Some of the most popular types of programmers include:<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Web developers<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong><a href=\"\/tutorials\/what-is-a-web-developer\/\" rel=\"noopener\">Web developers<\/a><\/strong> can be further separated into <strong><a href=\"\/tutorials\/entry-level-front-end-developer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">front-end<\/a> <\/strong>(client-side) and <strong><a href=\"\/tutorials\/what-is-a-back-end-developer\/\" rel=\"noopener\">back-end<\/a><\/strong> (server-side) developers. <strong>Front-end programmers are responsible for writing the code that dictates what a website looks like<\/strong> and how its content is presented.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Back-end programmers<\/strong> are required to <strong>write web apps and other complicated programs that provide the framework for the website to run on.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Software programmers<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong><a href=\"\/tutorials\/how-to-become-a-software-developer\/\" rel=\"noopener\">Software programmers<\/a><\/strong> areas you can probably guess - <strong>responsible for creating software.<\/strong> They usually take a design or a concept that someone else has come up with and write the code to turn it into a working product.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Data scientists<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong><a href=\"\/tutorials\/how-to-become-a-data-scientist\/\" rel=\"noopener\">Data scientists<\/a><\/strong> usually work in <strong>research or academia<\/strong>, where they <strong>use <a href=\"\/goon\/introduction-to-python%20%20%20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\">Python<\/a><\/strong> almost exclusively to analyze and manipulate scientific data.<\/p>\n<p>To become a data scientist it is first most important to know how to become a programmer. These specialists are often <strong>researchers in their own right<\/strong>, and they often use code to make their job easier.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Database Administrator<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Database administrators have several roles. They are mainly <strong>responsible for taking large amounts of company data and securing, organizing, and analyzing it.<\/strong> If you love statistics and consumer data analysis, you should take a closer look at what a database administrator does.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Mobile app development<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>As the number of smartphone users grows, <strong>the demand for exciting new mobile apps also grows<\/strong>. Mobile app development is quickly becoming <strong>one of the most lucrative programming fields,<\/strong> especially if you are good at working on your own. Freelance work is very common for mobile programmers.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Other Roles<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Learning how to become a programmer <strong>opens many more opportunities<\/strong>. The above <strong>are just some of the most common programming jobs<\/strong>. If none of them appeal to you, do some more research and <strong>discover what other jobs are out there<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>New job titles and roles are being created all the time as technology evolves, so <strong>make sure that you follow the latest industry news<\/strong> and network with your fellow programmers.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Learn a Programming Language (or Three)<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Once you have settled on a programming field, <strong>you need to learn the languages that are relevant to that field<\/strong>. For example, you will need <a href=\"\/goon\/sql-course-coursera\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\"><strong>SQL<\/strong><\/a> to become a database administrator, <a href=\"\/goon\/udacity-intro-to-html-and-css-course\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\"><strong>CSS<\/strong><\/a>, and <a href=\"\/goon\/javascript-course\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\"><strong>JavaScript<\/strong><\/a> to become a front-end web developer, and something like <a href=\"\/goon\/javascript-course\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\"><strong>Java<\/strong><\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Swift_(programming_language)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\"><strong>Swift<\/strong><\/a> if you want to start building mobile apps.<\/p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Learn coding: programming languages\" src=\"https:\/\/media.bitdegree.org\/storage\/media\/images\/programming languages.o.jpg\" alt=\"How to become a programmer: programming languages\" width=\"680\" height=\"454\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Below are some of <strong>the most popular programming languages and their uses<\/strong>. Make sure that you do your research to ensure that you are <strong>learning the right languages<\/strong> for the field that you are hoping to get into.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Python<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Learning how to become a programmer in Python is <strong>crucial for a modern-day coder. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the most versatile and widespread programming languages in the world, <strong>Python is a great choice for people who want to work in data science, software development, or pretty much any other programming field<\/strong>. Python is also used in some emerging technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence.<\/p>\n<p>Learning Python has never been easier than it is now. If you want to learn about the basics of Python syntax, how to write codes and other useful things just <a href=\"\/goon\/introduction-to-python%20%20%20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\"><strong>take a course online!<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<h4><strong>CSS\/HTML<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>If you want to get into any sort of <strong>front-end web development<\/strong>, then <strong>HTML and CSS are an absolute must<\/strong>. Although they are <strong>two separate languages<\/strong>, they are almost exclusively <strong>used together<\/strong> to create engaging, cleverly designed web pages.<\/p>\n<p>Learn HTML and CSS together with the <a href=\"\/goon\/udacity-intro-to-html-and-css-course\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\"><strong>HTML and CSS course<\/strong><\/a>, or learn them separately from our instructors.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>JavaScript<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>JavaScript is another <strong>versatile programming language<\/strong> that is used for many things. If you want to learn how to become a programmer, <strong>JavaScript could be a good place to start<\/strong>. It is used for interactive <strong>front-end web design<\/strong>, <strong>back-end web app development<\/strong>, <strong>game development<\/strong>, and <strong>even in robotics<\/strong>!<\/p>\n<p>You can learn <strong>JavaScript easily online<\/strong>. All you have to do is sign up for <a href=\"\/goon\/edx-javascript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\"><strong>a course!<\/strong><\/a> If you already have prior knowledge but want to deepen your understanding of JavaScript, take this <a href=\"\/goon\/javascript-course\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\"><strong>intermediate JavaScript course<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Java<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>If you want to learn how to become a programmer <strong>quickly<\/strong>, <strong>learn Java<\/strong>. Java is up there with Python as one of <strong>the most versatile languages in the world<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>It is quite <strong>simple to learn<\/strong>, it reads like English, and it is a <strong>favorite among beginners<\/strong>. It is used for everything from Android mobile app development to back-end web app development, and you can learn it via the <strong><a href=\"\/goon\/javascript-course\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\">Learn Java course<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Swift<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Swift was recently <strong>released by Apple<\/strong> to make <strong>iOS app development<\/strong> simpler and more straightforward. It is much <strong>easier to use than C#<\/strong> - the language traditionally used by Apple - and allows beginners to build mobile iOS apps without too much trouble.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to learn how to be a program for iOS apps, learn Swift! <strong><a href=\"\/course\/learn-swift-programming\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\">Learn Swift Programming course<\/a><\/strong> is a great choice to get you started.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Solidity<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>If you're wondering how to become a programmer that works with <strong>blockchain technologies,<\/strong> then Solidity is your answer. Solidity is probably <strong>the least well-known and the least popular programming language on this list<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"What programming language should I learn: blockchain\" src=\"https:\/\/media.bitdegree.org\/storage\/media\/images\/blockchain-5f3a593e7275b.o.jpg\" alt=\"How to become a programmer: blockchain\" width=\"680\" height=\"376\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It is <strong>used to develop <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Smart_contract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\">smart contracts<\/a> on the Ethereum blockchain<\/strong>. The rise of cryptocurrencies and blockchain has led to an increase in the demand for Solidity developers, which is why we have included it here. Learn how to be a good programmer with Solidity by taking either of our two offered <strong><a href=\"\/search?q=Solidity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\">courses on it.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Ruby<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The last language on our list, Ruby, has become popular due to its uses as a <strong>full-stack web development language. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Originally designed in Japan for building games, Ruby is another <strong>versatile language with several use cases<\/strong>, and it&rsquo;s worth considering if you want to get into web or game development. Have a look at the <strong><a href=\"\/course\/learn-ruby-on-rails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex noopener\">Learn Ruby on Rails course<\/a><\/strong> if you&rsquo;re interested.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Step 4: Practice, Practice &amp; Practice Some More<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>So you want to know how to become a programmer right? Well, here&rsquo;s a little secret for you:<\/p>\n<p><strong>You have to practice. You have to practice a lot! <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s right (surprise surprise), the key to becoming a good programmer is <strong>practice<\/strong>! Practice writing code from the moment you start learning. <strong>Download a code editor in your browser and write your little programs.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Share them and ask other people to critique your code. Try and learn something new every single day, and <strong>practice until you are completely fluent in all aspects of your chosen languages.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Step 5: Start Building A Portfolio Of Work<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>While you are practicing, <strong>you need to start building a portfolio<\/strong>. Want to know how to become a computer programmer? Well, one of the keys is <strong>having a decent portfolio<\/strong> that you can show to prospective employers.<\/p>\n<p>When you go to apply for a job as an entry-level programmer, remember that there are probably at least <strong>a few other people who are applying for the same job.<\/strong> You need to do something that <strong>makes you stand out<\/strong> above and ahead of the crowd. A portfolio is a great way to do this.<\/p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"How to become a programmer: applying for a job\" src=\"https:\/\/media.bitdegree.org\/storage\/media\/images\/applying for a job.o.jpg\" alt=\"How to become a programmer: applying for a job\" width=\"680\" height=\"454\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While you are learning how to become a programmer, <strong>save all of the little bits of code that you write.<\/strong> Store them somewhere - a website is a great idea, as you can <strong>customize or even build it using your coding knowledge<\/strong> - and make them accessible to potential employers when you&rsquo;re applying for a job.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Step 6: Apply For Jobs<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><em>By now you&rsquo;re well on the way to learning how to be a good programmer<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>You have <strong>picked a programming field<\/strong>, you have started to <strong>learn the skills<\/strong> and programming languages that you will need, and you have started<strong> practicing writing your code.<\/strong> You have <strong>put together a portfolio<\/strong> that showcases all of your work, and you have <strong>(hopefully) crafted a new resume<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>You may have guessed it already, but it&rsquo;s <strong>time to start applying for jobs<\/strong>! Search for <strong>entry-level programming jobs <\/strong>that are related to the languages that you have learned and the type of programming that you want to do.<\/p>\n<p>Send your resume and any other information that the potential employers want, and <strong>cross your fingers while you wait for a reply.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t hear back from any job applications for a while, <strong>the simple act of applying is good practice. <\/strong>A big part of how to become a programmer is <strong>learning how to present your skills to the employers<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In the same way, <strong>don&rsquo;t expect to land a job from your first interview<\/strong>. If you haven&rsquo;t interviewed for a serious job before, you will probably be nervous and you might make mistakes.<\/p>\n<p>Consider your first few interviews practice. <strong>Keep on applying<\/strong>, and you will eventually get offered your first job as a professional programmer!<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, <strong>consider taking freelance jobs<\/strong> to keep honing your skills and to make sure that your programming skills don&rsquo;t get rusty.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Step 7: Never Stop Learning! <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>As you can imagine, <strong>programming is a rapidly developing field<\/strong>.

<li>Programming is <strong>pretty easy to learn when compared to other skills</strong> that can take three or more years at university. <em>Sure, you could waste a few years of your life and learn programming at uni</em>, but why would you when <strong>you can <a href="/goon/edx-homepage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener">learn it in a few months online?</a> </strong>Platforms such as Udemy offer <a href="/goon/introduction-to-python-programming-udemy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener"><strong>great courses for beginners to try out</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are plenty of reasons why you would want to become a programmer. Luckily for you, I&rsquo;m here to show you <strong>exactly how to do just that in seven simple steps. </strong></p>
<p>By the way, one of the best things about learning programming is that there are so many ways to do it. You can enroll in an <strong><a href="https://potomac.edu/it-degree-guide/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener">IT degree program</a></strong>, or start on your own with online courses, exercises, and peer help.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-understand-why-you-want-to-start-programming"><span class="copy-heading"></span><strong>Step 1: Understand Why You Want To Start Programming</strong></h3>
<p>The first and one of the most important steps on how to become a programmer is <strong>identifying your reasons for starting</strong>. Sit down and have a good hard think about the following questions, as your answers will help you decide exactly which path to take:</p>
<h4><strong>Why do you want to learn programming? </strong></h4>
<p>This is a very important question that you absolutely <strong>must ask yourself</strong> before you go any further. Do you want to <strong>turn it into a career</strong>? Do you <strong>have a project or concept that you want to turn into a reality on your own?</strong></p>
<p><strong><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="How to become a programmer: man thinking" data-src="https://media.bitdegree.org/storage/media/images/man thinking.o.jpg" src="data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=" alt="How to become a programmer: man thinking" width="680" height="367" /></strong></p>
<p>Or do you simply want to learn how to be a programmer because <strong>it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s &lsquo;cool&rsquo; at the moment?</strong> Answer honestly, because the language that you choose to learn will depend on your answer to this question.</p>
<h4><strong>What do you hope to do with your new knowledge? </strong></h4>
<p>Again, you need to identify <strong>exactly what you want to do with your new programming knowledge</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, the courses you need to take and the languages you need to learn if you want to become a software developer or systems engineer <strong>will be a lot different</strong> from the skills you need to make a few changes to the layout of your blog.</p>
<h4><strong>Are you serious about learning to program? </strong></h4>
<p>This <strong>a very important question to ask</strong>. Are you serious about learning how to become a programmer and in getting a job in the field, <em>or is it just a fad</em>? If you are serious, then you need to be able to <strong>allocate as much time as possible to learning programming skills so that you can start working ASAP!</strong></p>
<h4><strong>What sort of programming do you want to do? </strong></h4>
<p>More on this in <strong><em>Step 2</em></strong>, but you need to think closely about <strong>what sort of programming you want to do </strong>and what field you want to go into.</p>
<p>Do you want to become a <strong>back-end web developer</strong>? <strong>A software engineer</strong>? Or do you want to <strong>work on something like artificial intelligence</strong> (AI) or another emerging technology? The answer to this question will help shape the learning pathway that you take, so be honest with yourself.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="How to become a programmer: man thinking" data-src="https://media.bitdegree.org/storage/media/images/man deciding.o.jpg" src="data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=" alt="How to become a programmer: man thinking" width="680" height="454" /></p>
<p>Once you have answered these questions honestly and recorded your answers, it&rsquo;s time to <strong>move onto step two</strong>: choosing what sort of programming you want to do and then we'll move on to the question on how to become a programmer.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-decide-what-field-you-want-to-go-into"><span class="copy-heading"></span><strong>Step 2: Decide What Field You Want To Go Into</strong></h3>
<p>There are a <strong>variety of different types of programming</strong>. When you are figuring out how to learn programming, you need to think very carefully about <strong>what field you are planning on looking for work in.</strong> Some of the most popular types of programmers include:</p>
<h4><strong>Web developers</strong></h4>
<p><strong><a href="/tutorials/what-is-a-web-developer/" rel="noopener">Web developers</a></strong> can be further separated into <strong><a href="/tutorials/entry-level-front-end-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">front-end</a> </strong>(client-side) and <strong><a href="/tutorials/what-is-a-back-end-developer/" rel="noopener">back-end</a></strong> (server-side) developers. <strong>Front-end programmers are responsible for writing the code that dictates what a website looks like</strong> and how its content is presented.</p>
<p><strong>Back-end programmers</strong> are required to <strong>write web apps and other complicated programs that provide the framework for the website to run on.</strong></p>
<h4><strong>Software programmers</strong></h4>
<p><strong><a href="/tutorials/how-to-become-a-software-developer/" rel="noopener">Software programmers</a></strong> areas you can probably guess - <strong>responsible for creating software.</strong> They usually take a design or a concept that someone else has come up with and write the code to turn it into a working product.</p>
<h4><strong>Data scientists</strong></h4>
<p><strong><a href="/tutorials/how-to-become-a-data-scientist/" rel="noopener">Data scientists</a></strong> usually work in <strong>research or academia</strong>, where they <strong>use <a href="/goon/introduction-to-python%20%20%20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener">Python</a></strong> almost exclusively to analyze and manipulate scientific data.</p>
<p>To become a data scientist it is first most important to know how to become a programmer. These specialists are often <strong>researchers in their own right</strong>, and they often use code to make their job easier.</p>
<h4><strong>Database Administrator</strong></h4>
<p>Database administrators have several roles. They are mainly <strong>responsible for taking large amounts of company data and securing, organizing, and analyzing it.</strong> If you love statistics and consumer data analysis, you should take a closer look at what a database administrator does.</p>
<h4><strong>Mobile app development</strong></h4>
<p>As the number of smartphone users grows, <strong>the demand for exciting new mobile apps also grows</strong>. Mobile app development is quickly becoming <strong>one of the most lucrative programming fields,</strong> especially if you are good at working on your own. Freelance work is very common for mobile programmers.</p>
<h4><strong>Other Roles</strong></h4>
<p>Learning how to become a programmer <strong>opens many more opportunities</strong>. The above <strong>are just some of the most common programming jobs</strong>. If none of them appeal to you, do some more research and <strong>discover what other jobs are out there</strong>.</p>
<p>New job titles and roles are being created all the time as technology evolves, so <strong>make sure that you follow the latest industry news</strong> and network with your fellow programmers.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-learn-a-programming-language-or-three"><span class="copy-heading"></span><strong>Step 3: Learn a Programming Language (or Three)</strong></h3>
<p>Once you have settled on a programming field, <strong>you need to learn the languages that are relevant to that field</strong>. For example, you will need <a href="/goon/sql-course-coursera" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener"><strong>SQL</strong></a> to become a database administrator, <a href="/goon/udacity-intro-to-html-and-css-course" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener"><strong>CSS</strong></a>, and <a href="/goon/javascript-course" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener"><strong>JavaScript</strong></a> to become a front-end web developer, and something like <a href="/goon/javascript-course" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener"><strong>Java</strong></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener"><strong>Swift</strong></a> if you want to start building mobile apps.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Learn coding: programming languages" data-src="https://media.bitdegree.org/storage/media/images/programming languages.o.jpg" src="data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=" alt="How to become a programmer: programming languages" width="680" height="454" /></p>
<p>Below are some of <strong>the most popular programming languages and their uses</strong>. Make sure that you do your research to ensure that you are <strong>learning the right languages</strong> for the field that you are hoping to get into.</p>
<h4><strong>Python</strong></h4>
<p>Learning how to become a programmer in Python is <strong>crucial for a modern-day coder. </strong></p>
<p>One of the most versatile and widespread programming languages in the world, <strong>Python is a great choice for people who want to work in data science, software development, or pretty much any other programming field</strong>. Python is also used in some emerging technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>

<h4><strong>Solidity</strong></h4>
<p>If you're wondering how to become a programmer that works with <strong>blockchain technologies,</strong> then Solidity is your answer. Solidity is probably <strong>the least well-known and the least popular programming language on this list</strong>.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="What programming language should I learn: blockchain" data-src="https://media.bitdegree.org/storage/media/images/blockchain-5f3a593e7275b.o.jpg" src="data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=" alt="How to become a programmer: blockchain" width="680" height="376" /></p>
<p>It is <strong>used to develop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener">smart contracts</a> on the Ethereum blockchain</strong>. The rise of cryptocurrencies and blockchain has led to an increase in the demand for Solidity developers, which is why we have included it here. Learn how to be a good programmer with Solidity by taking either of our two offered <strong><a href="/search?q=Solidity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener">courses on it.</a></strong></p>
<h4><strong>Ruby</strong></h4>
<p>The last language on our list, Ruby, has become popular due to its uses as a <strong>full-stack web development language. </strong></p>
<p>Originally designed in Japan for building games, Ruby is another <strong>versatile language with several use cases</strong>, and it&rsquo;s worth considering if you want to get into web or game development. Have a look at the <strong><a href="/course/learn-ruby-on-rails" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noindex noopener">Learn Ruby on Rails course</a></strong> if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-practice-practice-amp-practice-some-more"><span class="copy-heading"></span><strong>Step 4: Practice, Practice &amp; Practice Some More</strong></h3>
<p>So you want to know how to become a programmer right? Well, here&rsquo;s a little secret for you:</p>
<p><strong>You have to practice. You have to practice a lot! </strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right (surprise surprise), the key to becoming a good programmer is <strong>practice</strong>! Practice writing code from the moment you start learning. <strong>Download a code editor in your browser and write your little programs.</strong></p>
<p>Share them and ask other people to critique your code. Try and learn something new every single day, and <strong>practice until you are completely fluent in all aspects of your chosen languages.</strong></p>
<h3 id="step-5-start-building-a-portfolio-of-work"><span class="copy-heading"></span><strong>Step 5: Start Building A Portfolio Of Work</strong></h3>
<p>While you are practicing, <strong>you need to start building a portfolio</strong>. Want to know how to become a computer programmer? Well, one of the keys is <strong>having a decent portfolio</strong> that you can show to prospective employers.</p>
<p>When you go to apply for a job as an entry-level programmer, remember that there are probably at least <strong>a few other people who are applying for the same job.</strong> You need to do something that <strong>makes you stand out</strong> above and ahead of the crowd. A portfolio is a great way to do this.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="How to become a programmer: applying for a job" data-src="https://media.bitdegree.org/storage/media/images/applying for a job.o.jpg" src="data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=" alt="How to become a programmer: applying for a job" width="680" height="454" /></p>
<p>While you are learning how to become a programmer, <strong>save all of the little bits of code that you write.</strong> Store them somewhere - a website is a great idea, as you can <strong>customize or even build it using your coding knowledge</strong> - and make them accessible to potential employers when you&rsquo;re applying for a job.</p>
<h3 id="step-6-apply-for-jobs"><span class="copy-heading"></span><strong>Step 6: Apply For Jobs</strong></h3>
<p><em>By now you&rsquo;re well on the way to learning how to be a good programmer</em>.</p>
<p>You have <strong>picked a programming field</strong>, you have started to <strong>learn the skills</strong> and programming languages that you will need, and you have started<strong> practicing writing your code.</strong> You have <strong>put together a portfolio</strong> that showcases all of your work, and you have <strong>(hopefully) crafted a new resume</strong>.</p>
<p>You may have guessed it already, but it&rsquo;s <strong>time to start applying for jobs</strong>! Search for <strong>entry-level programming jobs </strong>that are related to the languages that you have learned and the type of programming that you want to do.</p>
<p>Send your resume and any other information that the potential employers want, and <strong>cross your fingers while you wait for a reply.</strong></p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t hear back from any job applications for a while, <strong>the simple act of applying is good practice. </strong>A big part of how to become a programmer is <strong>learning how to present your skills to the employers</strong>.</p>
<p>In the same way, <strong>don&rsquo;t expect to land a job from your first interview</strong>. If you haven&rsquo;t interviewed for a serious job before, you will probably be nervous and you might make mistakes.</p>
<p>Consider your first few interviews practice. <strong>Keep on applying</strong>, and you will eventually get offered your first job as a professional programmer!</p>
<p>In the meantime, <strong>consider taking freelance jobs</strong> to keep honing your skills and to make sure that your programming skills don&rsquo;t get rusty.</p>
<h3 id="step-7-never-stop-learning"><span class="copy-heading"></span><strong>Step 7: Never Stop Learning! </strong></h3>
<p>As you can imagine, <strong>programming is a rapidly developing field</strong>. Learning how to become a programmer today <strong>won&rsquo;t necessarily give you the skills that you need to remain a good programmer for the next few decades</strong>. You need to <strong>keep learning new skills and new languages</strong>.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="" data-src="https://media.bitdegree.org/storage/media/images/programmer-5f312fdb7ff76.o.jpg" src="data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=" alt="How to become a programmer: programmer" width="680" height="454" /></p>
<p>I find it a good practice to <strong>try and learn something new every day</strong>. This could be a new piece of syntax, a new tool that you can use with your favorite language, or a new way of writing a program. <em>It doesn&rsquo;t matter, as long as you continue to learn!</em></p>
